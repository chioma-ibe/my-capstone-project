Description


This pull request builds on the Firebase authentication setup and improves the overall user auth flow. 
Renamed properties in the contextValue object to make them more intuitive


Connected the signup component to the signup function from AuthContext


Users can now sign up and log in fully


Updated PrivateRoute to check the loading state and render child components after auth check


Navbar now shows relevant links when a user is logged in and a logout button


Added a logout handler in the navbar for full sign-out functionality


When thereâ€™s no user, the app shows the login and signup components


What will be done in later PRs:
Show user-specific data after login
Update Profile Page to Use Real Data
Add API endpoint to fetch user profile
Create a custom hook to retrieve user data from the backend
Replace hard coded data in the Profile component with real database values 
Add profile editing 
Add API endpoint to get the user profile and fetch user data
Update the Profile component to show actual user info (name, email, courses)

My  tests confirm that
Signing up and logging in works as expected new users are being stored in my database and passwords are not stored in plain text


Firebase Auth is syncing with the app state


PrivateRoute correctly protects content


Navbar updates based on auth status


Logout works and refreshes the view


Login and signup forms are shown when no user is logged in





Milestones this supports
Complete signup and login functionality


Centralized auth management using context


rendering components based on auth state


Allowing users view their custom pages
